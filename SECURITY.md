# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repo just pulls in other repos, so there's not a lot I can (or will be able to) do about security vulns, but if you find one, let me know.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Raise an issue.  Let me know if you've raised one on the upsteam repo where it exists (or if it is in my repo alone).

I'll follow up if I can, or let you know why I can't if I can't.
